1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program? Give an example. (1pt)
you use the number sign to comment in a single line
# Hello World!

2.) If a=2 and b=5, predict all of the following below and record your predictions. (9pts)
Then in the Python Console window, enter a=2 and b=5 and then all of the following and record the actual output.
If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!
Comment about any of your predictions that didn't match the actual output

b/a                 = 2.5                                   2.5
b//a                = 2                                     2
b**a                = 25                                    25
b%a                 = 1                                     1
a+B                 = 7                                     7
type(42)            = 42                                    int     forgot what type did thought it would type out 42
type(42.0)          = 42.0                                  float   forgot what type did thought it would type out 42.0
type("C3PO")        = C3PO                                  str     forgot what type did thought it would type out C3PO
type(True)          = True                                  bool    forgot what type did thought it would type out True


3.) Predict what would be the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines        (2pts)
into the Python Console Window? Then actually do it and record the output and comment on differences
between your predictions and the output.

a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a             = 15                                          15.0    forgot that dividing turned an int into a float
type(a)       = int                                         float   forgot that dividing turned an int into a float


4.) What is the mistake in the following code? Comment it and fix it!  (1pt)

x,y = (4,5)
# did not have asterisk after the 3 and before the parenthesis
a = 3*(x + y)
a


5.) What is the mistake in the following code so it will calculate the average? Comment it and fix it!  (1pt)

x,y,z =(3,4,5)
# does not have parenthesis around x+y+z
ave = (x+y+z)/3
ave
